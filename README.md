# daily-coach-ai

You are designing a well designed app. Be thoughtful about your creative decisions and how you arrange the UI. Follow best principles for a well rounded application.

The app is to help coach inviduals. It's aimed at business owners who are running their own business or are very busy. 

The features of the app are:

- Users can record a daily voice note. 
- Users can recieve daily Ai suggestions and summaries to guide them. 

The summaries and suggestions need to feel transformational.

Just mock all the data for now and focus on building a great front end UI.
